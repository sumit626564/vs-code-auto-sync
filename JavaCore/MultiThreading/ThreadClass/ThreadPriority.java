/* Background Information:
 *  Java Threads
 *      The JVM defines a range of ten logical priorities for Java Thread, including:
 *      sytnax:-
 *              java.lang.Thread.MIN_PRIORITY = 1
 *              java.lang.Thread.NORM_PRIORITY = 5
 *              java.lang.Thread.MAX_PRIORITY = 10
 * 
 * These values [1..10] are passed into Thread."setPriority(int)" to assign priorities to java thread.
 * The Default priority of a Java thread is NORM_PRIORITY. (A Java thread that doesn't explicitly call "setPriority" runs at NORM_PRIORITY.)
